# Ambari Installation CentOS 6.7

Before configuring the server, the JDBC driver may need to be installed.

    $yum install mysql-connector-java*

## Set up the FQDN for all hosts
Ambari needs the Fully Qualified Domain Names of the hosts in the cluster in order to work.

Configure the /etc/hosts file and /etc/sysconfig/network files to configure the FQDN.

This is the screen that you want to get to. If you do not get to this screen read through the “/var/run/ambari-server/bootstrap/*/bootstrap.err” file to correct any errors.

After the installation, hosts will be checked for any additional errors.
Use the HostCleanup script to correct these errors and manually correct errors not fixed by the script.

    $python /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/ambari_agent/HostCleanup.py --silent

In order to disable transparent huge page we will need to write a script.

    $vi /etc/init.d/disable-transparent-hugepages

Paste the contents into the file.

       if [ -d /sys/kernmel/mm/transparent_hugepage ]; then

       echo 'never' >${thp_path}/defrag
       unset thp_path
       ;;
    esac

Change the permissions

    $sudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/disable-transparent-hugepages

Copy the file to all other host machines in the cluster.

    $scp /etc/init.d/disable-transparent-hugepages <OtherMachineName>:/etc/init.d/

##Run these commands on all the machines on the cluster.

Add the file to chkconfig to run the script before ambari-server starts

    $sudo chkconfig --add disable-transparent-hugepages

Start the Script

    $/etc/init.d/disable-transparent-hugepages start

Once you see this and all checks pass on the hosts you can click the next Icon.
