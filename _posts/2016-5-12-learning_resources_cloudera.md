# Cloudera Big Data Resources

Cloudera has a downloadable image that is a great way to learn your way around Hadoop.  4 GB of RAM is required by the VM. Your total RAM must be higher than 4GB, so your system can still operate while running the VM.

The documentation is not very good at walking you through the whole process.  Hopefully, this will help.

Go to   <a href="http://www.cloudera.com/downloads/quickstart_vms/5-7.html" target="blank">QuickStart Downloads for CDH 5.7</a> and got to the *Select A Platform* dropdown to select a verstion that is compatible with VMWare Workstion, or VirtualBox.  I can't say why, but I used VMware for this image, and VirtualBox for the Udacity image.  Udacity has a great course that provides its own image.  You can check it out under the Udacity tab in Learning Resources.  

The image is a free download, but you must create an account.  The file is right at 5 GB when unpacked.

Virtualization software used to create virtual machines
 - <a href="https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_workstation_player/12_0" target="blank">VMware Workstation 12</a>
 - <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/virtualbox/downloads/index.html#vbox" target="blank">Oracle VirtualBox</a>

To open the image with VMware Workstation

Browse for a Virtual Machine
 1. Select File > Open.
 2. In the file selection window, find and select the virtual machine package or configuration file for the virtual machine to open.
    - Virtual machine package files have the extension .vmwarevm. Virtual machine configuration files have the extension .vmx. You can view a file's extension by selecting File > Get info.
 3. Click the Open button.
