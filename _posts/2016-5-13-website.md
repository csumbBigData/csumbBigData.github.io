# Powered by Jekyll and GitHub

It is always great when you find a new solution to an old problem.

The primary goal of the capstone project that necessitated this website, was to pass information along to future students.  Our first idea was to create a Wiki page on GitHub, and use that as the primary way disseminate the data.  The problem with that, is the Wiki page is hidden away, and has limited layout options.  

##Markdown

Markdown is one of the native ways to format data on GitHub Wikis.  It is very intuitive, and easy to read.

A few quick examples:

\# Header

# Header

\*\*Bold\*\*

**Bold**

\*Italic\*

*Italic*

##Jekyll



Jekyll is a static website generator, which allows you to use Markdown and HTML to format pages.  It also takes advantage of the template engine Liquid, to allow the creation of easy, and good looking layouts.
