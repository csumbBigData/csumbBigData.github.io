This website was created with the hope that it would provide a resource to get started with big data.  It is part of a senior capstone project at California State University at Monterey Bay.
  
A four-man team has conducted research, implemented a cluster on Amazon Web Services, and on four connected machines.  Cloudera and Ambari distributions were both installed, and a few exercises were performed using Sqoop, streaming, and MapReduce.

A lot of the material found here references other sources.  It is what we found most important to our understanding of concepts, and implementation.  Hopefully you find the organization, links, and summary of information useful.
