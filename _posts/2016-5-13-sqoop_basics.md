# Using Sqoop

Sqoop is a tool to migrate data from a MySQL database management system into the Haddop file system (HDFS). It works much like any other tool installed wit Hadoop, and requires a command with arguments.

An example command, run on our system looks like this:

    sqoop import --verbose --connect "jdbc:oracle:thin:hadoop/hadoop@//numbertwo:1521/orcl" --username hadoop -P --table TYLER.TWEETS

_--connect_
